Insights from Sales Dashboard Analysis
1. Relationship Between Discount and Quantity Sold
There is a clear positive correlation between sales discounts and quantity sold. As discounts
increase, customers tend to purchase more units, indicating that promotional pricing effectively
drives higher sales volumes.
2. Sales and Profit Distribution by Customer Segment
The analysis of customer segments reveals the following order in terms of sales and profit:
Home Office < Corporate < Consumer
• The Consumer segment leads with the highest sales and profitability.
• The Corporate segment follows, contributing moderate sales and profits.
• The Home Office segment records the lowest sales and profits.
Interestingly, while sales differ significantly among these segments, profits show less variation,
suggesting differences in discounting strategies or cost structures across segments.
3. Profitability by Shipping Class
The Standard shipping class outperforms other shipping methods in terms of profitability. This
highlights an opportunity to optimize shipping strategies by promoting Standard shipping to
maximize profit margins.
Business Recommendations
• Leverage Discount Strategies: Since discounts boost quantity sold, businesses can strategically
use discounts to increase sales volume, while monitoring the impact on profit margins.
• Focus on High-Value Customer Segments: Prioritize marketing and sales efforts toward the
Consumer segment to maximize revenue and profits. Evaluate and enhance the profitability of
Corporate and Home Office segments through targeted pricing or cost management.
• Optimize Shipping Options: Encourage the use of Standard shipping where feasible, as it
generates higher profit margins compared to other shipping classes.
